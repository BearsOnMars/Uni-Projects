__1. Portfolio Management (ICM 201): Individual Assignment March-April 2021__
  * I was tasked with formulating a 3-year plausible outlook for equity markets to theoretically invest £1 million in equities, by researching and understanding top asset managers' market outlook reports. 
  * The amount was mandated to be invested in long-only, actively-managed Mutual Funds, EU regulated UCITS Funds or open-ended funds. The mutual funds were required to have the same base currency, and be managed by one of the top 100 global asset managers. Furthermore, each fund's asset under management (AUM) must be no less than £ 500 million.
  * I used Bloomberg Terminal exclusively to search for funds which would match the aforementioned criteria, after analysing the global equity markets trends. After selecting the funds which met the mandate and my market-outlook, I imported funds' monthly price data for last 5 calendar years and calculated key performance and volatility ratios, tracking error, fund beta against benchmark and annualised volatility.
  * I recommended distributing investments among SAVCOMI LN (JPM Natural Resources Fund), SCHRTKI LN (Schroder Tokyo Fund) and MRCGLDI LN (BlackRock Gold and General Fund). My analysis was influenced the most by impending inflationary pressures on global economy. As of writing (Sept 2021), this is the current state of my recommendations
