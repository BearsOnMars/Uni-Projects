__1. Portfolio Management (ICM 201): Individual Assignment March-April 2021__
  * I was tasked with formulating a 3-year plausible outlook for equity markets to theoretically invest £1 million in equities, by researching and understanding top asset managers' market outlook reports. 
  * The amount was mandated to be invested in long-only, actively-managed Mutual Funds, EU regulated UCITS Funds or open-ended funds. The mutual funds were required to have the same base currency, and be managed by one of the top 100 global asset managers. Furthermore, each fund's asset under management (AUM) must be no less than £ 500 million.
  * I used Bloomberg Terminal exclusively to search for funds which would match the aforementioned criteria, after analysing the global equity markets trends. After selecting the funds which met the mandate and my market-outlook, I imported funds' monthly price data for last 5 calendar years and calculated key performance and volatility ratios, tracking error, fund beta against benchmark and annualised volatility.
  * I recommended distributing investments among SAVCOMI LN (JPM Natural Resources Fund), SCHRTKI LN (Schroder Tokyo Fund) and MRCGLDI LN (BlackRock Gold and General Fund). My analysis was influenced the most by impending inflationary pressures on global economy. As of writing (Sept 2021), this is the current state of my recommendations

__2. Portfolio Management (ICM 201): Group Assignment March-May 2021__
  * Our Team was given an investment mandate from UK-based client with a Long-term horizon, and with £50 million to invest in a global portfolio. The goal was to outperform a composite benchmark comprising of 70% MSCI Developed Markets Index and 30% MSCI Emerging Markets Index, subject to maximum ex-ante tracking error of 
16% per annum.
  * After deliberation, global-macro analysis and poring over company fundamentals, we ended up with 9 stocks and 3 ETFs. Further tasks were divided among the team members, and I was responsible for analysing the past performance of selected securities, and for constructing the portfolio. Refinitiv Eikon was used as the data source.
  * After calculating excess returns of our assets and adjusting for autocorrelation, Bootstrapping was performed to gain an idea of expected returns, based on the historical behaviour of our assets. To do so, sample return generated from 12 random data points was fed into a simulation. A variance-covariance matrix was then constructed from this simulation to check the variability of returns.
  * I also heavily contributed to identifying the impending near and long-term risks to our portfolio.
  * The performance of securities in our portfolio is as follows since May 2021 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73054575/134037523-59c22850-5ab0-4414-8d49-c4771fbfa4e9.png)
