__1. Portfolio Management (ICM 201): Individual Assignment March-April 2021__
  * I was tasked with formulating a 3-year plausible outlook for equity markets to theoretically invest £1 million in equities, by researching and understanding top asset managers' market outlook reports. 
  * The amount was mandated to be invested in long-only, actively-managed Mutual Funds, EU regulated UCITS Funds or open-ended funds. The mutual funds were required to have the same base currency, and be managed by one of the top 100 global asset managers. Furthermore, each fund's asset under management (AUM) must be no less than £ 500 million.
  * I used Bloomberg Terminal exclusively to search for funds which would match the aforementioned criteria, after analysing the global equity markets trends. After selecting the funds which met the mandate and my market-outlook, I imported funds' monthly price data for last 5 calendar years and calculated key performance and volatility ratios, tracking error, fund beta against benchmark and annualised volatility.
  * I recommended distributing investments among SAVCOMI LN (JPM Natural Resources Fund), SCHRTKI LN (Schroder Tokyo Fund) and MRCGLDI LN (BlackRock Gold and General Fund). My analysis was influenced the most by impending inflationary pressures on global economy. As of writing (Sept 2021), this is the current state of my recommendations

__2. Portfolio Management (ICM 201): Group Assignment March-May 2021__
  * Our Team was given an investment mandate from UK-based client with a Long-term horizon, and with £50 million to invest in a global portfolio. The goal was to outperform a composite benchmark comprising of 70% MSCI Developed Markets Index and 30% MSCI Emerging Markets Index, subject to maximum ex-ante tracking error of 
16% per annum.
  * After deliberation, global-macro analysis and poring over company fundamentals, we ended up with 9 stocks and 3 ETFs. Further tasks were divided among the team members, and I was responsible for analysing the past performance of selected securities, and for constructing the portfolio. Refinitiv Eikon was used as the data source.
  * After calculating excess returns of our assets and adjusting for autocorrelation, Bootstrapping was performed to gain an idea of expected returns, based on the historical behaviour of our assets. To do so, sample return generated from 12 random data points was fed into a simulation. A variance-covariance matrix was then constructed from this simulation to check the variability of returns.
  * I also identified the impending near and long-term risks to our portfolio.
  * The performance of securities in our portfolio is as follows since May 2021 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73054575/134037523-59c22850-5ab0-4414-8d49-c4771fbfa4e9.png)


__3. Financial Markets (ICM 106): Group Project Oct-Dec 2020__
  * Our Team was tasked with exploring ESG issues in relation to bank lending and instututional investing policies. We were asked to identify main financial risks that may arise with climate-change, and how climate-change financial risks may differ from traditional risks. Furthermore, we were required to summarise the main recommendations put forward by the Financial Stability Board through the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and by the United Nations through the Principles for Responsible Banking for minimising the impact of climate change risk on the banking sector. 
  * Lastly, we needed to assess the strength and weaknesses of a UK-based mid-sized bank, with respect to ESG/climate change risks to its loan book (loan assets). We were required to develop an implementation strategy for identifying, managing and mitigating ESG/climate change portfolio risks for this bank.
  * I was responsible for researching the Financial Risks of Climate Change and how they differ from Traditional Risks. I also analysed Climate-Change risks faced by the bank of our choice (Metro Bank PLC), and performed a SWOT assessment of Metro Bank's Asset Book with respect to ESG/Climate change risks.
  * We learnt that Climate related financial risks are novel because they have the potential to affect the global economy at large, and are not limited to any particular industrial sectors. ESG factors should be considered in the risk assessment of medium and long-term projects, such as financing or mergers and acquisitions, with a certain financing scale. With regards to Metro Bank, we learnt that although the bank has made recent improvements in its ESG score, it still has a long way to go as you can see in the SWOT assessment below ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73054575/134041441-80a6fd00-65e0-4d3e-bd78-b76222354d0b.png)
